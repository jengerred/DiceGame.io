# DiceGame.io
## Description:
This project I created while following instruction from an instructor with the MIT XPRO course. I added some elements of my own like the Game Rules card and I made the dice a little more 3d. I also added an aption to add player name. 
## How to Run:  
Simply open the page, read the game rules and click play. You can enter your name(s) and begin playing. 
Game Rules:
- click "New Game" to begin.
- 2 players will take turns to roll the dice
- The player must choose if they would like to hold their score or risk rolling a one, and roll again.
- if a player rolls 1, no points will be added and it will be the next players turn.

Win: First player to score 100 total points

## Roadmap of future improvements:: 
I would like to make the dice 3d and give them a spinning affect, I would also like to display the dice when a player rolls a one.
